What is bud?
------
[bud](https://github.com/simpledotlabs/bud) is an open source bussiness assistant. The major ideia of the project is that you, as a very occupied person, use bud to make things easier, while you use your energy
to work in more complex tasks, bud will handle the boring tasks like making a report or a sheet.
