<p align="center">This is just the first draft, I've made it in Blender in less than a hour</p>

What is bud?
------
[bud](https://github.com/simpledotlabs/bud) is an open-source bussiness assistant. The main ideia of the project is that, as a very busy person, you use bud to make things easier. While you direct your energy
in more complex tasks, bud will handle the boring tasks like making a report or a sheet.
